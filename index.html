                 <h1>Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights,
                 whether in the water or in the main square. There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon:
                 The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always been an integral part of the culture,
                 so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along. 
                 The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats are decorated on December 6th.</h1>

                 <h1> Venice Carnival, Italy Carnival traditions vary widely around the
                 world, from Mardi Gras in New Orleans to the Samba parades in Rio de Janeiro.
                 In Venice, Carnival is all about the masked costume balls. The most in-demand
                 ones like the famous Il Ballo del Doge, the official dinner at Ca 'Vendramin
                 Calergi and the popular Casanova Grand Ball, tend to be prohibitively expensive
                 and sell out quickly, but there are plenty of free events in addition to the
                 balls. As for the backstory, Venice Carnival is tied to a 12th-century Catholic
                 custom that likely evolved from winter solstice practices and marked a period 
                 of full-out debauchery before the no-fun season of Lent began. However, it can
                 be argued that plenty of debauchery can still be found today during the two
                 weeks in February leading up to Lent.</h1>

                 <h1>Winter Solstice is an ancient tradition — possibly dating as far back as the Stone Age
                 — that observes the shortest day of the year. This occurs a few days before Christmas,
                 and even though it’s celebrated in different forms everywhere from Sweden to Iran,
                 England's Stonehenge is thought to be one of the earliest epicenters for marking the 
                 longest night of the year due to the placement of the stones. In fact, the Winter Solstice
                 is still celebrated at Stonehenge, and anyone can buy tickets to experience the sunrise,
                 along with Druid and Pagan traditions.</h1>
